## About the Game

File Frenzy is set in a conceptual environment resembling a computer, where each component corresponds to a mini-game. The goal is to protect valuable files and data from being stolen by hackers or destroyed, while completing a series of mini-games.

The platform supports interactive learning by integrating gamified elements that make the process enjoyable. Concepts from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are applied throughout the project.

## Project Overview

File Frenzy is an educational platform that merges interactive learning with the engaging elements of a strategic game.  
The platform is designed to help users understand and apply concepts from **Module 5** (Creating and Using Digital Content on Various Platforms) and **Module 6** (Data Visualization, Manipulation, and Ethical Attribution).

The game features a map designed as a virtual computer. Each component of the computer corresponds to a mini-game designed to develop relevant skills and make the learning process enjoyable.  
The goal of the game is to protect the player's valuable files and data from being stolen by hackers or destroyed by completing a series of challenges and mini-games.
